# SQLiteLib
A library plugin that provides an easy way to use SQLite DB on MInecraft Servers.

# How to Use
**NOTE:** Some examples are written in TriggerReactor script language since that was my main purpose of writing this plugin; to use SQLite with TriggerReactor script. However, translating the script to Java should be very easy.

**What is TriggerReactor?** Trigger Reactor is a powerful scripting engine that provides an easy and convenient Minecraft server scripting environment. The engine provides amazing features such as importing Bukkit API methods and third-party plugin access. I am not paid to advertise this plugin... I simply love TriggerReactor!

# Future Updates
1. Implement a Cursor class that provides a better way to fetch data without parsing types, and allows using column names as parameter instead of column index numbers.
2. Image -> BLOB write support
3. Configuration to set default databases to connect when the plugin starts.
